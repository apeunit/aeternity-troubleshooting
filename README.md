# Troubleshooting
A repository tor track and triage general issues in the Aeternity environment


If there is an issue that is observed in the ecosystem and it is unclear which part of the stack the issue originates from, it should be reported in this repository.

The `triage` label will be assigned (automatically) and the issue template must be filled so that the issue can be properly identified. 

Beside the `triage` label also one of the `area` labels must be set indicating for which project the issue was initially reported (to aggreage data about where most of the issues are reported)

Once [SOMEBODY] identifies the proper area for the issue, the labels should be changed:
- `triage` should be removed
- the proper `area` should be added

and finally it must be indicated where the issue has been transferred, eg. by linking an issue in the target area repository.

At this point the issue in this reposiutory is considered correctly triaged and can be closed.
